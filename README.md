*Cereal Adventure* is an open-source video game currently under development. It's the culmination of my nearly life-long fascination with low-level video game development. It's powered by [*Delta Studio*](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/delta-studio), an open-source game engine. In-game graphics are in a nostalgic late 90s, early 2000s style but underneath, rendering is carried out by advanced shaders and modern techniques.

## Premise

You are a sentient cereal box that is very determined to be your owner's breakfast of choice. Unfortunately that means navigating a kitchen that's out to get you with obstacles and enemies at every turn. It's a simple game with basic platformer mechanics but more advanced physics and 3D graphics to showcase the abilities of the *Delta Game Engine*.

## YouTube

This project is featured in a devlog series on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0t1y4h_6-2SqEpXBXgwFQ). Check out the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_xqTv1MOuE&list=PLUahe1BHkKtUTFzQxqvJTX67Lnq3GGByc) for regular progress updates.

## Building the Code

As this codebase is currently not ready for release, I can't make any guarantees about whether it will build for you. I have recently migrated this project to CMake and the previous build steps are no longer applicable. I will update this section soon!
